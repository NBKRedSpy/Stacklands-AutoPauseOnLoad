Automatically pauses the game when a save is loaded and also when the player changes locations.

|Pause On Board Change|true|Pauses the game when the location is changed.| 

# First Visit Note
When visiting a location for the first time, the game will not allow the user to move the view until the dialog is finished and the first pack is opened.
This is a cutscene to welcome the player to location and will only occur once.
