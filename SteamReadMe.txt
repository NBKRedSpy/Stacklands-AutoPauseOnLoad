[h1]First Visit Note[/h1]

When visiting a location for the first time, the game will not allow the user to move the view until the dialog is finished and the first pack is opened.
This is a cutscene to welcome the player to location and will only occur once.

This mod was created based on jmucchiello's suggestion.
